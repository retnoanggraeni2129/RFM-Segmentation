# RFM-Segmentation

## Introduction to RFM Segmentation
Clustering is a data analysis technique that aims to group objects or data into groups (clusters) that have similar characteristics. In this context, objects in one cluster are more similar to each other than to objects in different clusters. 

RFM is a technique used to analyze and classify customers based on three main metrics, namely Recency, Frequency, and Monetary. This technique is very commonly used in customer segmentation and customer loyalty analysis.

## Objectives:
Segmentation:
- Segmentation Create customer segmentation on the superstore dataset using clustering or RFM techniques.
- Aggregate data at the transaction level.

## Results:
- Based on the bar graph, it is clear that Lost Customer has the highest frequency of consumers. 
- Lost Customers are customers who have not made transactions for a long time, very rarely make purchases, and tend not to spend much money.
- High Value is a segmentation with a low number of customers.
- Graphical analysis shows that the RFM score has increased every year. It follows a regular periodic pattern.
- This indicates that there are certain seasonal or cyclical factors affecting the RFM score. This provides insight into the overall increasing trend on a periodic basis, changes in RFM scores can also be predicted based on consistent time patterns from year to year.

## Summary
Customer segmentation analysis using the RFM model reveals critical insights into consumer behavior. 
The largest segment, Lost Customers, consists of infrequent shoppers with low spending, highlighting a need for re-engagement strategies. 
Conversely, the "high value" segment, though small, shows growing RFM scores, reflecting increasing loyalty and spending. 
Seasonal patterns in RFM scores indicate cyclical buying behavior, providing opportunities to align marketing efforts with peak engagement periods. 
Additionally, the analysis supports predictive insights for addressing future behavior shifts, optimizing marketing campaigns, and enhancing resource allocation.
